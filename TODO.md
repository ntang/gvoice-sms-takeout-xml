# TODO - Current Work Items

## üéâ **COMPLETE: Call/Voicemail Processing Fixed Successfully!**

### **Final Status**: Voicemails and call logs now fully processed and appear in conversation files ‚úÖ

---

## ‚úÖ **WORK COMPLETED**

### Call/Voicemail Processing Fix (September 21, 2025)
- **Issue**: Call logs and voicemails were not appearing in conversation files
- **Root Cause**: Wrapper functions in `file_processor.py` only extracted data but didn't write to conversation files
- **Solution**: Enhanced wrapper functions to call `write_call_entry` and `write_voicemail_entry`
- **Result**: 
  - ‚úÖ Call logs appear with proper formatting: `üìû Outgoing call to Unknown (Duration: 4s)`
  - ‚úÖ Voicemails appear with transcription: `üéôÔ∏è Voicemail from CharlesT (Duration: 3:19)`
  - ‚úÖ Statistics accurate in index.html (8 calls, 1 voicemail processed in test)
  - ‚úÖ No errors - system runs cleanly

### Exception Handling Improvements (September 21, 2025)
- **Enhanced Error Specificity**: Replaced broad exception handlers with specific TypeError, OSError, Exception handling
- **Silent Failure Fixes**: Replaced `except Exception: pass` with proper debug logging
- **Memory Monitoring**: Upgraded error visibility from debug to warning level
- **Defensive Programming**: Added manager validation and enhanced error logging

### KeyError 'num_img' Resolution (September 21, 2025)
- **Root Cause**: `ConversationManager.update_stats` accessed missing keys directly
- **Fix**: Used `.get()` method for safe dictionary access
- **Result**: No more KeyError exceptions, robust error handling

### Test Suite Enhancements (September 21, 2025)
- **New Test Suite**: Added `tests/test_num_img_error_fix.py` with 8 comprehensive TDD tests
- **Cache Issues Fixed**: Resolved `cache_clear()` issues in multiple test files
- **Core Tests**: All 26 core functionality tests pass
- **Coverage**: Exception handling, call/voicemail processing, error resolution

## üîß **CURRENT WORK: Date Filtering Fix (TDD-Driven)**

### **Issue Identified**: 
- Date filtering works at file level but not within conversation files
- Conversations include entire history if ANY message passes date filter
- Example: SusanT.html contains 30,436 messages from 2010-2025 even with potential date filters

### **Phase 0: TODO Setup and TDD Test Creation** ‚úÖ
- [x] Update TODO.md with comprehensive date filtering work plan
- [x] Create tests/test_date_filtering_fix.py with comprehensive failing test suite
- [x] Run tests to verify they fail (TDD RED phase) - 21 failed, 2 passed ‚úÖ

### **Phase 1: TDD Core Infrastructure**
- [ ] Create failing tests for message-level date filtering
- [ ] Implement _should_skip_by_date_filter() in ConversationManager
- [ ] Add config parameter to write_message_with_content()
- [ ] Verify core infrastructure tests pass (TDD GREEN phase)
- [ ] Refactor for clarity and performance
- [ ] Commit: "feat: implement message-level date filtering infrastructure"

### **Phase 2: SMS/MMS Integration (TDD)**
- [ ] Create failing tests for SMS/MMS date filtering integration
- [ ] Update SMS processing to pass config for date filtering
- [ ] Update MMS processing to pass config for date filtering
- [ ] Verify SMS/MMS date filtering tests pass
- [ ] Commit: "feat: integrate date filtering with SMS/MMS processing"

### **Phase 3: Call/Voicemail Integration (TDD)**
- [ ] Create failing tests for call/voicemail date filtering
- [ ] Update write_call_entry() to accept config parameter
- [ ] Update write_voicemail_entry() to accept config parameter
- [ ] Update wrapper functions to pass config parameter
- [ ] Verify call/voicemail date filtering tests pass
- [ ] Commit: "feat: integrate date filtering with call/voicemail processing"

### **Phase 4: Conversation Cleanup (TDD)**
- [ ] Create failing tests for empty conversation cleanup
- [ ] Implement empty conversation detection in finalize_conversation_files()
- [ ] Add conversation removal logic for filtered-empty conversations
- [ ] Verify cleanup tests pass
- [ ] Commit: "feat: remove empty conversations after date filtering"

### **Phase 5: End-to-End Validation**
- [ ] Create integration tests with real dataset
- [ ] Test --older-than filter with SusanT conversation
- [ ] Test --newer-than filter with SusanT conversation  
- [ ] Test combined filters (date range)
- [ ] Verify conversation files only contain messages within date range
- [ ] Verify statistics reflect filtered message counts
- [ ] Commit: "test: add end-to-end date filtering validation"

### **Phase 6: Final Integration**
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Test with large dataset to verify performance
- [ ] Update documentation with date filtering behavior
- [ ] Final commit and push all changes

### **Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Conversation files only contain messages within specified date range
- ‚úÖ Empty conversations (after filtering) are not created
- ‚úÖ File-level filtering performance preserved
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality works unchanged
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios

---

### Next Actions:
- **Current**: Phase 0 - Create comprehensive TDD test suite
- **Next**: Phase 1 - Implement core infrastructure following TDD principles

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Architecture Improvements

### Post-Call/Voicemail-Fix Improvements
These should be tackled AFTER the primary functionality is stable:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - HTML processing is the bottleneck (0.481s vs 0.020s for attachments)
   - Profile HTML processing to identify specific slow operations
   - Consider parallel processing for HTML files

2. **Configuration System Modernization** 
   - Further eliminate remaining global variable dependencies
   - Enhance parameter-based function design
   - Improve configuration consistency

3. **Memory Usage Optimization**
   - Implement memory monitoring and optimization
   - Reduce memory usage during large dataset processing

---

## üü¢ LOW PRIORITY - Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Test Coverage**
   - Fix remaining cache_clear() issues in older tests
   - Add more comprehensive test scenarios
   - Implement metrics collection
   - Add performance regression testing

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Update user guides
   - Enhance API documentation
   - Create troubleshooting guides

3. **User Experience**
   - Improve CLI help and error messages
   - Add progress indicators for long operations
   - Enhance logging and diagnostics
