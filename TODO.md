# TODO - Current Work Items

## üìã **CURRENT STATUS**

### Repository State:
- ‚úÖ **Date Filtering**: Fully implemented and functional - messages outside date range are filtered at write time
- ‚úÖ **Call/Voicemail Processing**: Fully functional - calls and voicemails appear in conversation files  
- ‚úÖ **Exception Handling**: Improved with specific error types and enhanced logging
- ‚úÖ **Test Suite**: All core functionality tests passing
- ‚úÖ **All changes committed and pushed to origin**

### Recent Major Completions:
1. **Date Filtering Implementation** (11a1acd) - Complete message-level date filtering with conversation cleanup
2. **Call/Voicemail Processing Fix** (f2b9b7a) - Fixed wrapper functions to write entries to conversation files
3. **KeyError Resolution** (87b187c) - Fixed 'num_img' KeyError with defensive programming

## üîß **CURRENT WORK: Enhanced Metrics System Implementation (TDD-Driven)**

### **Issue Identified**:
- Enhanced metrics system infrastructure exists but not connected to processing
- End of run shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced metrics unavailable: no metrics collected"
- Missing integration of `track_processing()` context manager in processing functions

### **Phase 0: TODO Setup and TDD Test Creation** ‚úÖ
- [x] Update TODO.md with comprehensive enhanced metrics work plan
- [x] Create tests/test_enhanced_metrics_integration.py with comprehensive failing test suite
- [x] Run tests to verify they fail (TDD RED phase) - 8 failed, 3 passed ‚úÖ

### **Phase 1: TDD Core Integration**
- [ ] Create failing tests for metrics collection in processing functions
- [ ] Implement track_processing() context manager integration
- [ ] Add metrics success/failure tracking
- [ ] Verify core metrics collection tests pass (TDD GREEN phase)
- [ ] Commit: "feat: integrate enhanced metrics collection with processing functions"

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Metrics Tracking**
- [ ] Create failing tests for detailed metrics (messages, participants, attachments)
- [ ] Implement detailed metrics updates in processing loops
- [ ] Add performance and efficiency metrics calculation
- [ ] Verify enhanced metrics tests pass
- [ ] Commit: "feat: add detailed processing metrics and efficiency tracking"

### **Phase 3: End-to-End Validation**
- [ ] Create integration test with real processing workflow
- [ ] Verify metrics summary shows comprehensive data instead of "no metrics collected"
- [ ] Validate performance impact is minimal
- [ ] Test with various file types (SMS/MMS/calls/voicemails)
- [ ] Commit: "feat: complete enhanced metrics system with full integration"

### **Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ End of run shows detailed metrics summary instead of "unavailable" message
- ‚úÖ Processing functions collect file-by-file metrics automatically
- ‚úÖ Metrics include success/failure rates, processing times, message counts
- ‚úÖ No performance degradation from metrics collection
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage for all metrics functionality

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Architecture Improvements

### Performance Optimization
- HTML processing is the bottleneck (0.481s vs 0.020s for attachments)
- Profile HTML processing to identify specific slow operations  
- Consider parallel processing for HTML files

### Configuration System Modernization
- Further eliminate remaining global variable dependencies
- Enhance parameter-based function design
- Improve configuration consistency

### Memory Usage Optimization  
- Implement memory monitoring and optimization
- Reduce memory usage during large dataset processing

---

## üü¢ LOW PRIORITY - Future Enhancements

### Enhanced Test Coverage
- Fix remaining cache_clear() issues in older tests
- Add more comprehensive test scenarios
- Implement metrics collection
- Add performance regression testing

### Documentation Improvements
- Update user guides
- Enhance API documentation  
- Create troubleshooting guides

### User Experience
- Improve CLI help and error messages
- Add progress indicators for long operations
- Enhance logging and diagnostics
