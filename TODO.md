# TODO - Current Work Items

## üéâ **COMPLETE: Call/Voicemail Processing Fixed Successfully!**

### **Final Status**: Voicemails and call logs now fully processed and appear in conversation files ‚úÖ

---

## ‚úÖ **WORK COMPLETED**

### Call/Voicemail Processing Fix (September 21, 2025)
- **Issue**: Call logs and voicemails were not appearing in conversation files
- **Root Cause**: Wrapper functions in `file_processor.py` only extracted data but didn't write to conversation files
- **Solution**: Enhanced wrapper functions to call `write_call_entry` and `write_voicemail_entry`
- **Result**: 
  - ‚úÖ Call logs appear with proper formatting: `üìû Outgoing call to Unknown (Duration: 4s)`
  - ‚úÖ Voicemails appear with transcription: `üéôÔ∏è Voicemail from CharlesT (Duration: 3:19)`
  - ‚úÖ Statistics accurate in index.html (8 calls, 1 voicemail processed in test)
  - ‚úÖ No errors - system runs cleanly

### Exception Handling Improvements (September 21, 2025)
- **Enhanced Error Specificity**: Replaced broad exception handlers with specific TypeError, OSError, Exception handling
- **Silent Failure Fixes**: Replaced `except Exception: pass` with proper debug logging
- **Memory Monitoring**: Upgraded error visibility from debug to warning level
- **Defensive Programming**: Added manager validation and enhanced error logging

### KeyError 'num_img' Resolution (September 21, 2025)
- **Root Cause**: `ConversationManager.update_stats` accessed missing keys directly
- **Fix**: Used `.get()` method for safe dictionary access
- **Result**: No more KeyError exceptions, robust error handling

### Test Suite Enhancements (September 21, 2025)
- **New Test Suite**: Added `tests/test_num_img_error_fix.py` with 8 comprehensive TDD tests
- **Cache Issues Fixed**: Resolved `cache_clear()` issues in multiple test files
- **Core Tests**: All 26 core functionality tests pass
- **Coverage**: Exception handling, call/voicemail processing, error resolution

## üìã **CURRENT STATUS**

### Repository State:
- ‚úÖ Call logs and voicemails fully functional
- ‚úÖ Exception handling improved with better error categorization
- ‚úÖ Defensive programming implemented
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
- ‚úÖ All changes committed and pushed to origin

### Recent Commits:
1. `feat: improve exception handling specificity and fix call/voicemail processing` (f2b9b7a)
2. `fix: resolve KeyError 'num_img' in ConversationManager.update_stats` (87b187c)  
3. `test: add comprehensive test suite for call/voicemail processing and fix cache issues` (0be9fb4)

### Next Actions:
- **None required** - primary issue resolved successfully
- **Optional**: Address remaining test failures related to cache_clear() in older tests

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Architecture Improvements

### Post-Call/Voicemail-Fix Improvements
These should be tackled AFTER the primary functionality is stable:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - HTML processing is the bottleneck (0.481s vs 0.020s for attachments)
   - Profile HTML processing to identify specific slow operations
   - Consider parallel processing for HTML files

2. **Configuration System Modernization** 
   - Further eliminate remaining global variable dependencies
   - Enhance parameter-based function design
   - Improve configuration consistency

3. **Memory Usage Optimization**
   - Implement memory monitoring and optimization
   - Reduce memory usage during large dataset processing

---

## üü¢ LOW PRIORITY - Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Test Coverage**
   - Fix remaining cache_clear() issues in older tests
   - Add more comprehensive test scenarios
   - Implement metrics collection
   - Add performance regression testing

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Update user guides
   - Enhance API documentation
   - Create troubleshooting guides

3. **User Experience**
   - Improve CLI help and error messages
   - Add progress indicators for long operations
   - Enhance logging and diagnostics
