# TODO - Current Work Items

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Test Suite Rebuild

### Overview
63 tests are currently failing due to test isolation issues. These tests pass individually but fail when run together, indicating complex state dependencies. The tests need to be rebuilt cleanly from scratch.

### Current Status: PLANNING PHASE
- **Analysis Complete**: Test categories and rebuild plan documented
- **Risk Assessment**: Phase-by-phase approach with LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk categorization
- **Next Action**: Begin with LOW RISK phases to build momentum

### Phase-by-Phase Rebuild Plan

#### ðŸŸ¢ LOW RISK PHASES (Tackle First - 6-10 hours)
- **Phase 2**: HTML Output Tests (4 tests) - 1-2 hours
- **Phase 3**: Index Generation Tests (2 tests) - 30-60 minutes  
- **Phase 9**: Call and Voicemail Tests (2 tests) - 1-2 hours
- **Phase 10**: Date Filtering Tests (2 tests) - 1-2 hours
- **Phase 11**: Service Code Tests (2 tests) - 1-2 hours
- **Phase 13**: Conversation Management Tests (2 tests) - 1-2 hours

#### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM RISK PHASES (11-15 hours)
- **Phase 4**: Timestamp Extraction Tests (8 tests) - 3-4 hours
- **Phase 5**: Phone Number and Alias Extraction Tests (12 tests) - 4-5 hours
- **Phase 8**: Group Conversation Tests (3 tests) - 2-3 hours
- **Phase 12**: Message Type and Processing Tests (3 tests) - 2-3 hours

#### ðŸ”´ HIGH RISK PHASES (Save for Last - 11-14 hours)
- **Phase 6**: MMS Processing Tests (8 tests) - 5-6 hours
- **Phase 7**: Filename Processing Tests (15 tests) - 6-8 hours

## ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Architecture Improvements

### Post-Test-Rebuild Improvements
These should be tackled AFTER the test suite is rebuilt and stable:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - HTML processing is the bottleneck (0.481s vs 0.020s for attachments)
   - Profile HTML processing to identify specific slow operations
   - Consider parallel processing for HTML files

2. **Configuration System Modernization** 
   - Further eliminate remaining global variable dependencies
   - Enhance parameter-based function design
   - Improve configuration consistency

3. **Memory Usage Optimization**
   - Implement memory monitoring and optimization
   - Reduce memory usage during large dataset processing

---

## ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY - Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Test Coverage**
   - Add more comprehensive test scenarios
   - Implement metrics collection
   - Add performance regression testing

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Update user guides
   - Enhance API documentation
   - Create troubleshooting guides

3. **User Experience**
   - Improve CLI help and error messages
   - Add progress indicators for long operations
   - Enhance logging and diagnostics

## âœ… RECENTLY COMPLETED

### Config Parameter Fix (Just Completed)
- âœ… Fixed 'config is not defined' error in `extract_call_info` and `extract_voicemail_info` functions
- âœ… Added config parameter to function signatures
- âœ… Updated function calls to pass config parameter
- âœ… Committed and pushed changes

### Major Architecture Migration (Previously Completed)
- âœ… Global variable elimination in filtering logic
- âœ… Dependency injection architecture implementation  
- âœ… Test mode performance fix (99%+ improvement)
- âœ… Configuration system improvements
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite for new architecture (47 tests)

## ðŸ“‹ EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Current Focus: Test Suite Rebuild
1. **Start with LOW RISK phases** to build momentum and validate approach
2. **Move to MEDIUM RISK phases** once confident in the process  
3. **Finish with HIGH RISK phases** when the framework is well-established

### Success Criteria
- All 63 tests rebuilt and passing individually
- All tests pass when run together (no isolation issues)
- Test suite is maintainable and well-documented
- No regressions in functionality

### Timeline Estimate
- **Total Effort**: ~28-39 hours
- **Recommended Pace**: 2-4 hours per session
- **Target Completion**: 2-3 weeks of focused work
