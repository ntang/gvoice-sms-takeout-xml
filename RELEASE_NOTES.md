# Release Notes

## Version 1.0.0 - Test Mode Performance Fix (September 20, 2025)

### 🚀 Major Improvements

#### Critical Bug Fix: Test Mode Performance Issue
- **Issue**: `--test-mode --test-limit N` was processing ALL files instead of just N files, causing extremely long execution times (hours)
- **Fix**: Synchronized global `LIMITED_HTML_FILES` variable with context configuration
- **Impact**: Test mode now processes exactly the specified number of files
- **Performance**: Execution time reduced from hours to seconds (99%+ improvement)

### 🧪 Test Mode Improvements
- **Before**: `--test-mode --test-limit 5` processed all files (potentially thousands)
- **After**: `--test-mode --test-limit 5` processes exactly 5 files
- **User Experience**: Test mode now works as expected for quick testing and validation

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `sms.py`: Added global variable synchronization (2 lines)
  - `tests/test_test_mode_bug.py`: Added comprehensive test suite
- **Risk Level**: Low (minimal code changes, easy rollback)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained (no breaking changes)

### 📊 Performance Metrics
| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix | Improvement |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Files Processed | All files | Limited count | ✅ Correct |
| Execution Time | Hours | < 1 second | 99%+ faster |
| Test Mode Working | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Fixed |
| User Experience | Poor | Excellent | Dramatically improved |

### 🧪 Testing Completed
- ✅ Unit tests: 6 tests (3 bug reproduction + 3 fix validation)
- ✅ Integration tests: CLI functionality validation
- ✅ Performance tests: Real-world scenario testing
- ✅ Regression tests: Full-run mode validation
- ✅ All tests passing

### 📝 Documentation Updates
- ✅ README.md updated with fix information
- ✅ CLI help text updated with fix notes
- ✅ Deployment documentation created
- ✅ Release notes created

### 🎯 User Impact
- **Immediate**: Test mode now works correctly
- **Performance**: Dramatic speed improvement for testing
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive test coverage prevents future regressions
- **Usability**: Users can now effectively test conversions with small datasets

### 🔄 Migration Notes
- **No migration required**: Fix is automatic
- **No configuration changes**: Existing settings work as expected
- **No data loss**: All functionality preserved

### 🛡️ Rollback Plan
